#  Sentence-Level GPT from Scratch

A lightweight, custom-built GPT-like Transformer language model trained from scratch on 85,000 English sentences.  
Utilizes a BERT tokenizer and includes full training, inference, and evaluation in a single Jupyter Notebook.

## 📁 Project Structure

This implementation is currently fully contained within a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and ease of experimentation.  
All steps — from tokenization and model architecture to training and evaluation — are accessible and well-documented.

Python scripts (`model.py`, `train.py`, etc.) have been initialized to support modularization.  
These files will be filled in future updates to transition toward a clean, production-ready codebase.

> 🔧 For now, please refer to the notebook for the complete working implementation.
